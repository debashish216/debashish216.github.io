This tutorial takes a look at the potential synergies between 5G/B5G cellular systems and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, specifically how UAVs can be added to existing cellular networks as new aerial user equipment (UE). There are a lot of unanswered questions and operational complications with cellular-connected UAVs, or UAV-UEs, that need to be addressed before this technology can be considered a viable solution for many new use cases. The goal of this tutorial is to provide attendees with a few pointers on how to approach this field by demonstrating various unique aspects of UAVs, problems with current solutions, and the perspective of aerial networking.

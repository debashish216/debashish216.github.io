## Overview
Due to spatio-temporal variation of mobile subscriberâ€™s data traffic requirements, traffic load experienced by base stations present at different cell sites exhibit highly dynamic behavior in traditional cellular systems. This non-uniform and dynamic traffic load leads to under utilization of the base station computing resources at cell sites. Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is an innovative architecture which addresses this issue and keeps the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) under safe limit for cellular operators. In C-RAN, the baseband processing units (BBUs) are segregated from cell sites and are pooled in a central cloud data center thereby facilitating shared access for a set of Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) present at cell sites. In order to truly exploit the benefits of C-RAN, the BBU pool deployed in the cloud has to efficiently serve clusters of RRHs (i.e., many-to-one mapping between RRHs and BBUs in the BBU pool) and thereby minimizing the required number of active BBUs.

We investigated the dynamic RRH-BBU mapping problem in C-RAN and studied the multiplexing gains achived by pooling BBUs in centralized cloud servers. Furthermore, a real-world testbed has been setup using an open-source implementation of 3GPP compliant cellular stack, OpenAirInterface (OAI) along with USRP-B210 SDR and commercial general purpose processor (GPP) servers. The deployment of the centralized CU on a remote server, and the RRUs, connected over Ethernet fronthaul is demonstrated.

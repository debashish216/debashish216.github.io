Advanced air mobility (AAM) is currently an active area of research and development led by academicians, avionic industries and researchers of intelligent transport system aiming to build next-generation modes of air transportation using autonomous or piloted, electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Among general public, some commonly used terms that abstractly depicts this idea are: flying taxis or air taxis or flying cars etc. For such eVTOLS to be able to transport human passengers or cargo, dedicated air corridors (air pathways) has to be defined among the vertiports that are safe, efficient and sustainable.       


In this study, we aim to deep dive into the key factors that influence design of air corridors connecting the vertiport along with the criterias to define a safe separation distance among eVTOL aircraft to avoid collisions.

## Overview
The integration of UAVs to 5G cellular network falls under four broad paradigms as shown in the following figure.

### UAV-Assisted Cellular Communication
In this paradigm, UAVs are realized as flying base stations, relays or localization anchors, that can intelligently reposition themselves to assist the existing terrestrial wireless communication system to improve the user perceivable Quality of Experience (QoE), spectral efficiency and coverage gains. We design and develop a proof-of-concept (PoC) prototype platform that delineates the design components required to implement such platforms in the real world, and we then explain the necessity for optimal placement of aerial base stations. To support a heterogeneous class of 5G services from various vertical industries, we propose a slicing-aware aerial base station framework for ground users with differentiated traffic requirements.

### Cellular-Assisted UAV Communication (Cellular-connected UAVs)
In this paradigm, the flying UAVs are realized as new aerial User Equipments (UEs) coexisting with terrestrial UEs that access the communication services from exising terrestrial cellular network infrastructure. This paradigm has gained significant interest in recent times, because of the effective solution for establishing reliable wireless connectivity with ground cellular stations.

### UAV–UAV Communication
In this paradigm, a group of UAVs reliably communicate directly with each other sharing the cellular spectrum with ground users in order to facilitate autonomous flight behaviours, cooperation in a UAV fleets, and collision avoidance. We emphasized on both centralized and decentralized network models for UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication inside swarm and studied sidelink-assisted U2U communication with performance assessment.

### Hybrid Non-terrestrial Network
This paradigm brings forward the notion of an integrated space-aerial-ground communication network encompassing an intermediary swarm of UAVs establishing linkages between ground and space network. The integration of heterogeneous networks, such as ’5G with satellites’ or ’5G with UAVs’, is already a part of the standardization process for 5G by 3GPP. There are continuing discussions to build and construct network architecture that combines cross-layer, high and low altitude platforms (HAPs and LAPs), and space satellites into conventional cellular networks in order to inject more capacity and improve coverage for underserved regions in a cost-effective way.
